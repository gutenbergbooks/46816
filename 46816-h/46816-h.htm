<h2>A TRIUMPH OF THE SCHOOL BOARD.</h2>

<p>The collector of statistics was fairly posed by the attitude assumed by
his visitor. The elderly lad (or, rather, very young man) had claimed
admittance on the score that he was an "old boy" of the School Board. He
wished to give his evidence anent the fate of the State-educated
juvenile population.</p>

<p>"And you say you are not one of the 547 clerks?" queried the collector.</p>

<p>"No Sir, I am not. I would rather beg my bread from door to door than
occupy a lofty stool from dawn to sundown."</p>

<p>"And you are not one of the 413 milkboys?"</p>

<p>"Again, no. It has been a tradition in our family for centuries to avoid
water, so how could I dabble in the milk trade?"</p>

<p>"And you are neither an actor, a jockey, nor a hairdresser?"</p>

<p>"I am not," was again the reply, couched in a tone of hauteur.</p>

<p>"And you are not a soldier&mdash;one of the ten that left the School
Board for the more or less tented field?"</p>

<p>"I am not&mdash;nor a sailor."</p>

<p>Then the collector of statistics paused for a moment, and spoke with a
measure of hesitation.</p>

<p>"You have not gone to the bad?"</p>

<p>"Like my 333 schoolfellows?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then the red blood of the visitor mounted to the roots of his hair and
suffused his cheeks with crimson. He indignantly denied the imputation.
He might be poor, but at any rate he was honest. "No, he had never been
in prison."</p>

<p>"Then what are you?" asked the collector, in a tone not entirely free
from traces of annoyance. "Surely you must be something!"</p>

<p>"I am more than something!" returned the visitor, proudly. "I am
<i>unique</i>&mdash;I am a curiosity."</p>

<p>"What may you be?"</p>

<p>"I am a boy, educated by the School Board, who is satisfied to follow in
the footsteps of his father. My father was a bricklayer, and I am
satisfied to lay bricks myself."</p>

<p>"My dear Sir," said the collector, grasping him cordially by the hand,
"I congratulate you. This is the first time I have met a boy who has
been satisfied to adopt the trade followed by his parent. And now you
can do me a small favour." And then the collector engaged his guest to
renovate the walls of his house, which (on account of the scarcity of
trained labour) had for many years been sadly out of repair.</p>

<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>

<p class="center">V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Parish Meeting.</span></p>

<p class="author">
<i>Mudford, December 4</i>, 11.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
</p>

<p>The Parish Meeting&mdash;long looked for, eagerly expected, anxiously
anticipated&mdash;has come and gone. It has been indeed an interesting
and eventful night.</p>

<p>The meeting was called for half-past seven, and, when I reached
the schoolroom, at two minutes before that time, the room was
packed with parochial electors. A subdued cheer broke out as
I entered, and, bowing my acknowledgments, I found my way to a
seat in the front row, which a thoughtful overseer had reserved for
me, his fellow overseer being stationed at the door to see that only
those were admitted who had got on the wedding garment; or, to put
it in a different way, whose names were on the Register. I soon saw
that, practically, everyone was present. There were the <span class="smcap">Marchites</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Letham Havittites</span>, and <span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> and his following, whilst
the Vicar and the Squire were there, to lend an air of real intelligence
and respectability to the whole affair. It never struck me before,
though, how dull a man the Vicar is when you see him without his
daughters&mdash;who, of course, were not present.</p>

<p>Punctually at 7.30 the overseer asked the meeting to proceed to
elect a chairman. There was a hush of expectant silence, and then
<span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> jumped up and proposed me. I had taken a great interest
in the subject, and the tremendous amount I knew about it made me
the most suitable person to take the chair that evening. A warm
glow of satisfaction came over me, which deepened into a sense of
burning joy when Mrs. <span class="smcap">March</span> seconded the motion, which was
agreed to unanimously.</p>

<p>I took the chair, and after a hurried glance at my instructions, invited
nominations to be sent in to me. Seven were sent in in the first
two minutes&mdash;nominations of the seven who had previously issued
election addresses. Then came an awful and an awkward pause. I
waited, for I had to wait for a quarter of an hour&mdash;the instructions
told me to. It was <i>un mauvais quart d'heure</i>. Of course I was
waiting for my own nomination. It is a humiliating fact to have to
record, but it did not come. Then the whole thing became clear to
me; my election to the chair was a sop to console me for being
shunted from the Parish Council. But I was not to be fobbed off in this
way. I put my hand in my pocket, and a minute before the time was
up produced a nomination paper which I had got my gardener and
coachman to sign. It is always well to be prepared for accidents.</p>

<p>However, even bad quarters of an hour come to an end, and at the
end of the remaining minute I announced that as I had been nominated
myself, I could not stay in the chair. This was evidently an unexpected
turn, but Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham Havitt</span> was equal to the occasion.
She proposed the assistant-overseer. He was elected, declared all the
eight nomination papers were in order, and then threw the meeting
open to questions.</p>

<p>The heckling began at once. I was the first victim over that confounded
Free Trout-fishing. Was I in favour of it? I said that as
all there was belonged to me, it was obvious I could hardly be expected
to answer the question. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span> and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham
Havitt</span> said they were prepared to use all the powers the Act conferred
as to free fishing. I noticed that a curious smile lurked
round the mouths of both, and I should have said, if I had not
thought it to be too incredible to be true, that Mrs. <span class="smcap">March</span> almost
winked her eye. Anyhow, the meeting cheered, and seemed satisfied.
<span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> made a long and impassioned speech, in which he called
the Act the Charter of the Peasants' Liberty. This, too, evoked great
enthusiasm. Finally the questioning flickered out, no one withdrew
their candidature, and the voting commenced. I had previously
noticed that there were 173 electors present. My name&mdash;<span class="smcap">Winkins</span>&mdash;came
last. Marvellous to relate, 173 hands were held up for each of
the first seven candidates&mdash;for I thought it only a courteous thing to
vote for my opponents. When my name was put, only 59 hands went
up. It will be noticed that the total number of votes was more than
seven times the number of votes, and no one ought to have voted
more than seven times! The show of hands was a fraud and a
farce, so it was only in common justice to the parish and myself
that I should demand a poll. A poll I did demand, and we are to
have an election on Monday week.</p>

<p>When I got home I found a letter from the Local Government
Board, referring me on the trout-fishing point to the words of the
Act, to which accordingly I at once turned. Then I saw that the
clause was "to utilize any ... stream within their parish ... but <i>so
as not to interfere with the rights of any corporation or person</i>...."
I had stopped short before at these last words. I understand at last
why Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span> winked&mdash;for wink I now know she did.

<p class="center">(<i>A very long way after the late Laureate's Version.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[On December 4, every rural parish will, for the first time, "assemble
for the purpose of managing, in some organised and systematic way, its
own affairs."&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>"He invited them to choose men, and women too, who they believed would
manage their parish affairs best.... If the leading landowner desired to
have a large influence in parish affairs, and if he were a fit man, by
all means give him the power; but if he was not a fit man, put in the
agricultural labourer." (Laughter and cheers.)&mdash;<i>Lord Ripon at

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXXIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The Yew Walk.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, as she watches <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> approaching</i>). How
badly he walks, and what <i>does</i> he mean by smiling at me like that?
(<i>Aloud, coldly.</i>) I am sorry, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>, but I must leave you to finish
your stroll alone; my maid has just told me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>vehemently</i>). Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, I ask you, in common fairness,
not to judge me until you have heard <i>my</i> version. You will not allow
the fact that I travelled down here in the same compartment with your
maid, <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>wide-eyed</i>). The <i>same!</i> But <i>we</i> came by that train. I
thought you missed it?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I&mdash;I was not so fortunate. It is rather a long and complicated
story, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I'm afraid I really can't listen to you <i>now</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>,
after what I have heard from <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I implore you not to go without hearing both sides. Sit down
again&mdash;if only for a minute. I feel confident that I can explain
everything satisfactorily.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>sitting down</i>). I can't imagine what there is to
explain&mdash;and really I ought, if <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> You know what maids <i>are</i>, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>. They embroider.
Unintentionally, I daresay, but still, they <i>do</i> embroider.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). She is very clever at mending lace, I know,
though what <i>that</i> has to do with it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Listen to me, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>. I came to this house at your bidding.
Yes, but for your written appeal, I should have treated the invitation I
received from your Aunt with silent contempt. Had I obeyed my first
impulse and ignored it, I should have been spared humiliations and
indignities which ought rather to excite your pity than&mdash;than any other
sensation. Think&mdash;try to realise what my feelings must have been when I
found myself expected by the butler here to sit down to supper with him
and the upper servants in the Housekeeper's Room!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>shocked</i>). Oh, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>! Indeed, I had no&mdash;&mdash;You
weren't <i>really!</i> How <i>could</i> they? What <i>did</i> you say?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>haughtily</i>). I believe I let him know my opinion of the
snobbery of his employers in treating a guest of theirs so cavalierly.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>distressed</i>). But surely&mdash;<i>surely</i> you couldn't suppose
that my Uncle and Aunt were capable of&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> What else <i>could</i> I suppose under the circumstances? It is
true I have since learnt that I was mistaken in this particular
instance; but I am not ignorant of the ingrained contempt you
Aristocrats have for all who live by exercising their intellect&mdash;the
bitter scorn of Birth for Brains!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I am afraid the&mdash;the contempt is all on the other
side; but if <i>that</i> is how you feel about it, I don't wonder that you
were indignant.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Indignant! I was <i>furious</i>. In fact, nothing would have induced
me to sit down to supper at all, if it hadn't been for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>in a small voice</i>). Then, you <i>did</i> sit down? With the
servants! Oh, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I thought you were already aware of it. Yes, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, I
endured even that. But (<i>with magnanimity</i>) you must not distress
yourself about it now. If <i>I</i> can forget it, surely you can do so!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Can I? That <i>you</i> should have consented, for any
consideration whatever; how could you&mdash;how <i>could</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She admires me all the more for it. But I <i>knew</i>
she would take the right view! (<i>Aloud, with pathos.</i>) I was only
compelled by absolute starvation. I had had an unusually light lunch,
and I was so hungry!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). That explains it, of course.... I hope
they gave you a good supper!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Excellent, thank you. Indeed, I was astonished at the variety and
even luxury of the table. There was a pyramid of quails&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I am pleased to hear it. But I thought there was
something you were going to explain.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I have been <i>endeavouring</i> to explain to the best of my ability
that if I have undesignedly been the cause of&mdash;er&mdash;a temporary diversion
in the state of Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson's</span> affections, no one could regret more
deeply than I that the&mdash;er&mdash;ordinary amenities of the supper-table
should have been mistaken for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>horrified</i>). Oh, stop Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>, please stop! I don't
want to hear any more. I see now. It was <i>you</i> who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Of course it was I. Surely the girl herself has been telling you
so just now!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You really thought <i>that</i> possible, too? She simply came
with a message from my mother.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>slightly disconcerted</i>). Oh! If I had known it was merely
<i>that</i>. However, I am sure I need not ask you to treat my&mdash;my
communication in the strictest confidence, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Indeed, that is <i>perfectly</i> unnecessary, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Yes, I felt from the first that I could trust you&mdash;even with my
life. And I cannot regret having told you, if it has enabled you to
understand me more thoroughly. It is such a relief that you know all,
and that there are no more secrets between us. You <i>do</i> feel that I only
acted as was natural and inevitable under the circumstances?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh, yes, yes. I&mdash;I daresay you could not help it. I mean
you did quite, <i>quite</i> right!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Ah, how you comfort me with your fresh girlish&mdash;&mdash;You are not
<i>going</i>, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>rising</i>). I must. I ought to have gone before. My mother
wants me. No, you are not to come too; you can go on and gather those
snowdrops, you know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She walks slowly back to the house.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>looking after her</i>). She took it wonderfully well. I've made
it all right, or she wouldn't have said that about the snowdrops.
Yes, she shall not be disappointed; she shall have her posy!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXXIV.</span>&mdash;<i>The Morning Room. Half an hour later.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>alone&mdash;to herself</i>). Thank Goodness, <i>that</i>'s over!
It was <i>awful</i>. I don't think I <i>ever</i> saw Mamma a deeper shade of

<p class="noid">and yet philander with my poor foolish <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> the moment he
met her! And then to tell Mamma about my letter like that! Why,
even Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> had more discretion&mdash;to be sure, <i>he</i> knew
nothing about it&mdash;but <i>that</i> makes no difference! <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> was right;
I ought to have allowed a margin; only I should never have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
allowed <i>enough!</i> The worst of it is that, if Mamma was unjust in
some things she said, she was right about <i>one</i>. I <i>have</i> disgusted

and loyal and a gentleman, and&mdash;and he did like me once.
He doesn't any more, or he wouldn't have gone away. And it may

sorry&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She turns, and sees</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>.) Oh, haven't
you gone <i>yet?</i></p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Yes, I went, but I've come back again. I&mdash;I
couldn't help it; 'pon my word I couldn't.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>with a sudden flush</i>). You&mdash;you weren't <i>sent</i> for&mdash;by&mdash;by
anyone?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> So <i>likely</i> anyone would send for me, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I don't know why I said that; it was silly, of
course. But how&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Ran it a bit too fine; got to Shuntin'bridge just in
time to see the tail end of the train disappearin'; wasn't another
for hours&mdash;not much to do <i>there</i>, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You might have taken a walk&mdash;or gone to Church.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> So I might, didn't occur to me; and besides, I&mdash;I
remembered I never said good-bye to <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Didn't you? And whose fault was that?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Not mine, anyhow. You were somewhere about the
grounds with Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Now you mention it, I believe I was. We had&mdash;rather
an interesting conversation. Still, you might have come to
look for me!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Perhaps you wouldn't have been over and above glad
to see me.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh, yes, I should!&mdash;When it was to say <i>good-bye</i>,
you know!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Ah! Well, I suppose I shall only be in the way if I
stop here any longer now.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Do you? What makes you say that?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Nothin'! Saw your friend, the Bard, hurryin' along
the terrace with a bunch of snowdrops; he'll be here in another&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>in unmistakable horror</i>). <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>, <i>why</i> didn't you
tell me before? There's only just time!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She flies to a door and opens it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> But I <i>say</i>, you know! <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, may I come too?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Don't be a <i>goose</i>, <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>. Of course you can, if
you like.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She disappears in the Conservatory.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Can't quite make this out, but I'm no

<span class="smcap">Maisie</span> will come in presently. (<i>He sits down, and re-arranges his
snowdrops.</i>) It will be sweet to see her face light up when I offer
her these as a symbol of the new and closer sympathy between us!
(<i>He hears the sound of drapery behind him.</i>) Ah, already!
(<i>Rising, and presenting his flowers with downcast eyes.</i>) I&mdash;I have

give me the pleasure of accepting them.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> I feel immensely proud. I was so afraid you must
have thought I was rather cross to you last night. I didn't mean to

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>A Strange Career</i> is the title of a book recently issued by
<span class="smcap">Blackwood</span>, and it sets forth the life and adventures of <span class="smcap">John
Gladwyn Jebb</span>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard</span> supplies an introduction,
in which he testifies touching Mr. <span class="smcap">Jebb</span> that of "all friends he
was the gentlest and truest, of all men the most trustful." At
first reading this testimony is almost necessary, for so wild were Mr.
<span class="smcap">Jebb</span>'s adventures in Mexico, so imminent his frequent peril, and so
miraculous his inevitable escape, that one seems to be reading a
work by Mr. <span class="smcap">Louis Stevenson</span>, or the author of <i>She</i>. In merit of
graphic power and style the work need not shrink from comparison
even with these masters of the art. It purports to be written by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jebb's</span> widow, but as the lady did not become his wife till his
strange career had several times been nearly brought to an abrupt
close, Mr. <span class="smcap">Jebb</span> must have been as effective with his pen as he was
with his gun. The picture of the eclipse of the sun seen from one
of the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains; the discovery of the
pipe-stem when digging round the snow-submerged site of a hut in
the mountains, a discovery which, carefully followed up, brought to
light "the whiteish-grey fingers of the dead man closely clutching
the bowl of the pipe"; the account of the revolt in the streets of the
city of Mexico; and the story of the coach party robbed by bandits
four times in a single day on a
journey from Puebla to Vera Cruz&mdash;these
are among the frequent
flashes in one of the most stirring
narratives that has for a long time
come in my Baronite's way.</p>

<p>Evidently "Mars," in return for our late curiosity, has been keeping his
eye on this gay little planet of ours. His experiences, published by the
Parisian firm of <i>Plon, Nourrit et Cie</i>, are pictorially related in <i>La
Vie de Londres</i>. Needless to remark it was our <i>C&ocirc;t&eacute;s riants</i> which
struck him.</p>

<p>The Baron cannot finish his notes of admiration without giving one of
them, and that a big one, to <i>Phil May's Annual</i>. That May should appear
to brighten up December fogs is nice in itself; and it is phill'd with
the best of May produce. "Another thing," quoth the Baron, "about this
annual by <span class="smcap">Phil May</span> is, that all <i>mes filles</i> can read it and see it with
pleasure."</p>

<p>At this time of year the Baron examines the "Hardy Annuals"
that are heaped upon his table. At the first examination he gives the
apple to the "Pip," <i>i.e.</i>, to the <i>The Penny Illustrated Paper</i>, that
is, as represented by its Christmas number called <i>Christmas Cards</i>.
Charming picture, too, of "<i>The Queen of Hearts</i>," photographed
from the life&mdash;"may she live long and prosper!"&mdash;and the story
re-latey'd by the indefatigable <span class="smcap">John Latey</span> "will delight the most
insatiable story-devourer," quoth</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Arranged on the strictest Lines of Truth.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><i>At</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Somebody's</span> <i>on "At Home" Day</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Somebody.</i> Well, I am pleased you have come at last, as I
wanted you to notice that, although you have a slightly better address,
my drawing-room is far larger than your own.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caller.</i> You are most kind to say so; and I may add that
we should not have dreamed to come to this out-of-the-way part of
the world had we not wished to purchase some cheap carpets in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Miss Caller.</i> I suppose your extremely plain daughter <span class="smcap">Araminta</span> is
away from home; she seldom contrives to hit it off with her mother.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Somebody.</i> You have guessed rightly; but I may say that
she is staying at Lady <span class="smcap">Dashaway's</span> place in the country. I mention
the fact casually, although I am glad to get in a title somehow in
the course of my conversation.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caller.</i> If you are obliging enough to give me the opportunity,
I will get in a dozen persons with handles to their names.
You will pardon the vulgarity?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Somebody.</i> Most certainly, as knowing that your father was
a bootmaker in a large way, and your mother the daughter of a
milliner, nothing else could be reasonably expected.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caller.</i> Aware that you may know something of my immediate
ancestry, I will leave no stone unturned to find an opening for
some reference to my uncle the curate.</p>

<p><i>Miss Caller.</i> Being glad to add on every conceivable occasion to
the list of my partners at any promiscuous charity ball that I may
patronise with my presence, I will ask after your eldest unmarried
son?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Somebody.</i> I thank you, my dear child, but as I intend him
to look rather higher than yourself for a matrimonial alliance, I will
meet your politic inquiry with a pailful of polite cold water.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Caller.</i> Having now consumed the regulation cup of cold
weak tea and section of luke-warm muffin, I will say good-bye, and
take my departure. But before leaving I will make special reference
to my brougham.</p>

<p><i>Miss Caller.</i> And I will add my <i>adieux</i>, after giving a good long
look at your hair, which seems to require attention at the roots.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Somebody.</i> I will warmly speed your parting, reflecting the
while, as a sop to my wounded feelings, that you are both looking
dreadfully old, and that your conveyance is merely a hired brougham.
No doubt your stay would have been longer if the charge per hour
had been what your vulgarian of a husband and father (who, thank
goodness, has <i>not</i> called) would term "easier."

When made aware of the situation, say, "Oh, I don't mind
smoking," and consider the question solved.</p>

<p>If a man, select carefully a compartment in which Two Young
People are ostentatiously trying to look as if they don't find their
own company quite sufficient for a journey of any duration.</p>

<p>If you are hurrying for a train, and want an easy, always slacken
just as you catch another person up, and walk close behind him,
panting and puffing till you are ready for another spurt.</p>

<p>Always read, or recite, your compositions to your friends. Believe
them when they protest they would really like you to do so.</p>

<p>Engage in serious argument with a woman with whom you wish
to be on really good terms&mdash;a rich relation for choice.</p>

<p>Always curse the waiters if the cook has failed in his treatment of
your chop or steak.</p>

<p>Always act contrary to the directions in crowded places of public
interest. This shows an imperial spirit, and will make you, for the
time, an object of general interest.</p>

<p>Always stay to the very end on any occasion when you have been
invited at the last moment.</p>

<p>Always talk loud, and, as far as possible, always talk about
yourself.</p>

<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<p>Pisa, placid Pisa, only awakened at half-past eleven by the rushing
tourist who traverses your sleepy streets. By the half-past two
train he starts afresh, and leaves you to doze as peacefully as before.
My train arrives with amazing punctuality, and I reach the hotel
earlier than was ever known; 11.35 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and apparently nobody up
yet. The <i>vetturino</i> loudly cracks his whip, but, to no purpose.
Suddenly I notice some electric bell-pushes. Ring one. Ring
another. Finally, ring them all. Then at last rushes out an
elegant gentleman, probably the manager, who excitedly endeavours
to speak, and to apologise, in four languages at once. Reduce him
to calmness, and to two languages, with a few words from a third
thrown in occasionally, and demand <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>. Another delay. The
elegant gentleman does not explain; but evidently the cook is still
asleep, and the waiters only just up. But at last I am served, and
excellently too, and go off to see the sights.</p>

<p>Unfortunately am seized with an insane wish to ascend the
Leaning Tower, when I might have remained comfortably on
the beautiful turf at the foot of it. Rouse the official at the door.
He says I cannot go up alone. Remember that sort of trick,
so tell him he may accompany me. He says he must stay below.
Remember also that sort of trick, and offer him a lira. He is
still unconvinced! Do not remember any trick of that sort. An
extraordinary <i>custode!</i> What will convince him? Am just asking
where I can find a companion, when a small, quiet man
strolls up. For fifty centesimi he will accompany me. That's
cheap enough, so follow him at once. The steps lean first one way
and then the other as one goes round the tower. It is like climbing
the companion way, as I think one should call it&mdash;say the staircase,
in plain English&mdash;of a steamer in a storm. Begin to dislike the
sensation, when my guide suddenly stops. He suggests that the
tower is very high and fifty centesimi very low. Tell him I don't
mind sixty or seventy, and on we go, round and round. Begin to feel
almost giddy&mdash;imagine a <i>circular</i> staircase in a steamer in a storm!&mdash;when
he stops again. Notice in the dim light that he is broad-shouldered
and muscular, though short. Pleasant sort of place for a
fight with a reckless ruffian! Perhaps he has weapons! He says I
ought to pay him a lira. Agree to this at once.</p>

<p>Up again, round and round. Think of all the mysterious murders
one reads of, and wish I had never come. Look up at him. He is
certainly bigger than I am. And what is that long straight thing
which makes his pocket stick out? Oh, horror! It must be a
knife, or a dagger in a sheath! Just then he stops, and says he would
like a cup of coffee when we get down again. How I wish we were
down again! Agree at once. Up a few more steps, and then he
stops again and says it is very hot, and he would like a bottle of
wine as well. Agree to this also at once. Up again, round and
round and round, and at last reach an outside gallery. Peep out
through the doorway. Refuse to trust myself beyond. There is
only a single iron rail, and that not all round. Guide says I might
as well give him five lire, to include the wine and coffee. Agree to
this also, and feebly suggest that I have seen enough. But he is
inexorable, and on we go again.</p>

<p class="caption2">"<i>Si, signore,</i>" says It is a flute.</p>
</div>

<p>At last at the top. Look over at happy, sleepy Pisa, and wish I
was down there. So I should be, pretty soon, if he threw me over!
Just then he says he would like a few cigars. Tell him I will
make it six lire, and that I should now like to go down. No! I
must see Livorno. Hang Livorno! But obey him meekly. Then he
says he has some antiquities for sale, among them some swords and
daggers. Ah! Just what I thought. Glance nervously at the
straight thing in his pocket, and say I will look at them. Then he
wants me to look over the iron railing at the sloping base below.
Hang over in the air? Never! But he will hold my legs. What?
Balance myself on a slender bar, while a brigand, as he probably is,
tilts me over by the boots? Would sooner buy all the antiquities in
Pisa. Good idea. Tell him I will buy his swords if I can go at once
to see them. Whereupon he hurries down so fast that I cannot keep
pace with him. But I feel happier as I get
nearer the outer world, and at last step out
safely on to the level earth. Look joyously
at the beautiful grass and the road to the
railway station. Then perceive the <i>custode</i>
and a little man with him. Can that be my
guide? Why, I could knock him down
easily! What a fool I was to be afraid of
him! Still, that dagger&mdash;I must pay him
the six lire as I have promised them. He
reminds me that I also promised to buy his
swords. Feel inclined to dispute this, but
cannot. So settle it by giving him six lire
more. Then, before hurrying to the station,
ask him to show me the thing in his pocket. "<i>Si, signore</i>," says
he, in a meek, deferential tone, and pulls it out. It is a flute.</p>

<h2>DIARY OF A DUCK.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>["It is even hinted that the London County
Council may fill the lakes and ponds of the Metropolitan
Parks with sea water."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Curious what a lot of human
beings have come to the water's edge to-day.
What's going to happen? St. James's Park
crammed with them. We don't mind, of
course. The more loafers, the more bits of
loaf and biscuit for <i>us</i>. Immense amount of
quacking going on, too, up at Spring Gardens.
What <i>can</i> it all mean?</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Headache. My liver must have
gone wrong, I fancy, as a result of yesterday's
unusual supply of eatables. What stale biscuits
some people do chuck into the water!
Those hard crusts, too, <i>don't</i> agree with me.
Same crowd as yesterday. They seem to be
waiting for something. Ask a goose what's
going on. Goose says, "Dinner," and gobbles
up a biscuit. Stupid creature!</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Appetite all right again&mdash;but
must be careful. Fortunately can pick
and choose <i>now</i>. Won't look at a crust. Inclined
to insist on fancy bread. Friendly
wild-fowl says just the same crowd waiting
round Serpentine, <i>which has been emptied</i>.
Will they empty <i>us?</i></p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;They will! No doubt about
it. Level steadily sinking. Crowd as usual.
None of us will touch anything under a bath
bun. What a slimy place we <i>do</i> seem to live
in, now it's being uncovered! Where's the
inspector of nuisances, I wonder?</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Water off! What'll be the next
move? Offered a Huntley and Palmer with
no sugar on it! Scandalous!</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;More quacking at Spring
Gardens. Then a sort of procession down to
the banks by members of the L. C. C. Ask
goose what a member of the L. C. C. means.
Goose says "Quack!" Idiotic bird. Water
really coming in now. Hurrah! Sure to be
fresh, anyhow. Have my first dive. How
my eyes smart! What funny water it is!
Taste some. Why,&mdash;<i>it's salt!</i> Just wondering
what this means, when a man comes
along, claps me into a hamper with all my
relations, and takes me off to Leadenhall
Market&mdash;so he calls it. Told that the L. C. C.
has filled all the park ponds with sea-water!
No more use for <i>us</i>&mdash;going to have a lot of
sea-gulls instead. What treachery! (<i>Later.</i>)
Sold.</p>

<h2>MORE SHE-NOTES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Iõpna</span>, <i>Author of "A Yellow Plaster."</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></p>

<p>Colour-blind from his tenth year, <span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span> (late of Christ's,
Oxford, not to be confused with Christchurch, Cambridge), had hitherto
ignored details of scenery; but now the vermiliony petal of the
pimpernel, the rubicund radix of the carrot, the blue of the insensate
bottle-fly&mdash;these reminded him respectively of the cheeks of <span class="smcap">Margerine</span>,
her hair, the spots in her grey eyes where, as we said, the soul looked
through. The harvest-sheaves again were, broadly speaking, her figure.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>Till now he had been impervious to the new femalehood, rising like
Proteus from the azure foam; dumbly he had waited for a woman with
possible potentialities, or, failing this, with potential possibilities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margerine</span>, whom we left a fortnight ago inarticulately gurgling by the
trout-stream, caught the note of a step in the briar-patch. With her
budding instinct she could tell her lover's footfall half a mile away,
waking the age-echo in her chest. This one was lighter and less
gregarious. In her sphinxy way she divined that it belonged to a woman
with Puritan impossibilities and a yellow plaster next her heart.</p>

<p>Under a mask of habitual and hereditary reticence, the step came on,
revealing a finished creature, gowned beyond all mending. <span class="smcap">Margerine</span>,
whose face was her ewe-lamb, became sub-acutely aware of her own
half-made frock, and yearned a little in the other's direction.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said; "how <i>did</i> you get it built that way? I mean
the gown." The woman's voice came through the envelope of
<span class="smcap">Margerine's</span> sub-consciousness, steely clear as a cheese-cutter.
"My name is Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span>. In other words, I am the wife
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span>!"</p>

<p>"The wife of <span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span>?" said the innocent girl; "I do
not follow you."</p>

<p>"Let me explain," said the other, unsparingly. "<span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span>,
who is now due at your trout-stream" (<span class="smcap">Margarine</span> smiled
stoopingly), "is my husband. I say, he married me. Once I had
a maiden name. That is all past. I changed it when I married.
All <i>honourable</i> women do. <i>I</i> am honourable. <i>I</i> changed mine.
Now I am Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chamois Hyde</span>. See?"</p>

<p>"Can't help that," said <span class="smcap">Margerine</span> cheerfully; "he loves <i>me</i>."
This was the folded-lamb's point of view.</p>

<p>"Girl, have you no shame?" This was the other woman's.</p>

<p>"Rather I blush for <i>you</i>," said the unfinished creature. "You
couldn't make him love you, <i>you</i> couldn't; you're the hankering
feminine counterpart of the man in the other book, the <i>Yellow
Plaster</i> book. Now it is too late. We love each other. The matter
is taken out of our hands. We are merely impassive, irresponsible,
agents. Do try and look at the case as I do, from an unbiassed, impersonal,
point of view; and see that the fault is utterly your own."</p>

<p>The girl's regard for her lover had suffered no transitional throwing-back
at the news of his deception. She was overwhelming with
her palpabilites. Ah! it is these that men love&mdash;palpabilities.
"And have I none?" moaned the unhappy wife. "If I could
blush, could only blush! He would have loved me then. But stay,
he is colour-blind; I forgot."</p>

<p>"I said just now I would blush <i>for</i> you," replied the other, who had
been under the eaves overhearing her thoughts. "And to think of the
chances you have missed, and with a gown like that! Why, if you are his
wife, you must often have met him about, and not had to make
arrangements at a trout-stream like me. Conceivably he has even kissed
you. I read once of a married man who kissed his wife." She suddenly
stopped; not that one of her intoxicating gutturals had come loose; but
an odd flood of pathos was playing on the other's brow as she caught
sight of <span class="smcap">Chamois</span> whistling aloofly behind a sycamore, and went in
thought all over that first kiss, complicated, perhaps, perhaps rather
billiardy, but still a thing to remember.</p>

<p>Like a cloud the stigma lifted, and <span class="smcap">Margerine</span> guessed her horrid
secret. "<i>You</i> love him too? I never thought of that. How forgetful
of me! But if <i>you</i> love him and <i>I</i> love him, why, we <i>both</i> love
him! This is too much!" For a moment both of them pulsated
even as one tuning-fork. Though sundered by the estranging ocean
of the past that had closed its lid between them, leaving them like
shuttlecocks, sick with strong doses of womanhood and experience,
now that <span class="smcap">Chamois</span>, steadied by his breeding, was rapidly joining
the party, the two women leaned against one another (how seldom
women do this!), and waited, containedly restless. But the man, as
I said before, comes into the next chapter, if we ever get as far.</p>

<h2>NEW HONOURS.</h2>

<p>Last week Solicitor-General <span class="smcap">Frank Lockwood, Q.C., M.P.</span>, was
knighted. So was the High Sheriff of Surrey, Mr. <span class="smcap">Fred Wigan</span>.
Quite appropriate that Queen's Counsel <span class="smcap">Lockwood</span> should appear
with Wig-an'&mdash;the gown too, of course. After this <span class="smcap">J. Weeks
Szlumper</span> was made a knight, and has now another "s" added to his
name. All hail, Sir <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span>, or "Zir <span class="smcap">Zlumper</span>!" As the ex-mayor
of Richmond quitted (backwards) the Royal Presence, did a
concealed choir sing a verse of the ancient ballad commencing
"Slumber my darling," and for this occasion altered to

<span class="scenter">"<span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> my darling!"</span></p>

<p>In the House of Commons, and elsewhere, the <span class="smcap">Secretary of State
for War</span> is accustomed to have appeals made to him
to assist in providing facilities for the engagement
and remunerative occupation of soldiers and non-commissioned
officers no longer on active service.
We are glad to notice, from the subjoined advertisement,
which appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> of Thursday,
that the public are themselves taking the matter
in hand:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="drop noid">TWO GENERALS WANTED, as Cook and Housemaid,
for one lady. Light, comfortable situation. Good
wages.&mdash;Apply, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The advertiser, it will be observed, flies at higher
rank than that usually considered in this connection.
But the situation is "light" and "comfortable," with
"good wages" pertaining, and she has some right to
look for applicants of superior station. We presume
that on festive occasions the gallant officers would be expected to
don their uniforms. Few things would be more striking than to see
a general, probably wearing his war medals, sweeping the front doorstep,
whilst through the kitchen window a glimpse was caught of a
brother officer, in full tog, larding a pheasant.</p>
